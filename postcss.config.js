Here's a `postcss.config.js` file tailored for a luxury FashionTV cosmetics website, using PostCSS with some common plugins that can help you achieve an elegant and high-end design. This configuration includes support for autoprefixing and CSS nesting, which can be useful for styling your components.

```javascript
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('postcss-import'), // Allows you to use @import in your CSS
    require('autoprefixer'), // Adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules
    require('postcss-nested'), // Enables nesting of CSS rules
    require('cssnano')({ preset: 'default' }) // Minifies the CSS for production
  ]
};
```

Make sure to install the necessary PostCSS plugins if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install postcss-import autoprefixer postcss-nested cssnano --save-dev
```

This configuration will help you maintain a clean and elegant CSS structure while ensuring compatibility across different browsers, which is essential for a high-end fashion website.
