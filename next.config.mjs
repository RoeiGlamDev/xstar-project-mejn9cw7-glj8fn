Here's a `next.config.mjs` file tailored for your luxury FashionTV cosmetics website, focusing on an elegant and high-end design in pink and white colors. This configuration includes some common settings that might be useful for a Next.js project.

```javascript
// next.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'next';

export default defineConfig({
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
  images: {
    domains: ['your-image-domain.com'], // Replace with your image domain
  },
  experimental: {
    appDir: true,
  },
  webpack: (config) => {
    // Custom webpack configuration if needed
    return config;
  },
  env: {
    // Add any environment variables here
    API_URL: process.env.API_URL,
  },
});
```

### Explanation:
- **reactStrictMode**: Enables React's Strict Mode for highlighting potential problems in an application.
- **swcMinify**: Uses SWC for minifying JavaScript, which can improve build performance.
- **images**: Configures allowed image domains for the Next.js Image component.
- **experimental.appDir**: Enables the experimental app directory feature for Next.js.
- **webpack**: Placeholder for any custom Webpack configurations you might need.
- **env**: Allows you to define environment variables that can be accessed in your application.

Make sure to replace `'your-image-domain.com'` with the actual domain from which you will be serving images. You can also add more configurations as needed based on your project requirements.
